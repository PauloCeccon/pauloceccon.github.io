        <h2>Bachelor in Science: Computer Engineering</h2>
        <p>
					I obtained my bachelor's degree from Ghent University in 2015.
					At Ghent University, all engineering disciplines (e.g. mechanical, chemical, physics, civil engineering) have in the first two years a lot of shared classes like calculus, linear algebra, physics, chemistry, material science, signal processing, electrical circuits and systems, etc.
					From the third year on, the more traditional Computer Science courses start, such as digital electronics, operating systems, information techology, etc.

        <h2>Software Developer</h2>
        <p>
					During the summer of 2015 I did an internship at <a href="https://www.inthepocket.mobi">"In the Pocket"</a> a leading Belgian company in IoT, VR and software development.
					During the intern I developed an Android App, called <a href="http://www.citie.be/">Citie</a>, which is reaching 10.000 downloads :).
					The app lets you collect points and eventually rewards by shopping in associated malls in Belgian cities.
					Besides this I researched the implications on apps when the smartphone was updated from Lollopop to Marshmallow Android OS.</p>

        <h2 class="story-heading">Exchange to National Taiwan University</h2>
        <p>
					During my second master year I was able to study one semester in Taiwan at the National University of Taiwan.
					At NTU I continued my master program with a focus on Robotics and studied the Chinese language.
					I found this exchange program extremely enriching and educational, both on a cultural and academic level.

				<h2 class="story-heading">Master in Science: Computer Engineering</h2>
				<p>
					In june 2017 I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from Ghent University.
					In my master I focused primarly on Machine Learning and Robotics.
					In my master's thesis, I studied Bayesian Machine Learning and more precisely "(Deep) Gaussian Processes".
					A copy of my thesis can be found here: <a href="https://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/002/367/115/RUG01-002367115_2017_0001_AC.pdf">UGent lib</a>.
